### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Blog

I seldomly write blog posts:

- [Replacing Teleport on a Budget (2025)](https://fungiboletus.github.io/replacing_teleport/)
- [VJ Ultra 3 Review (2025)](https://github.com/fungiboletus/vj_ultra_3)
- [Rossignol Vezor vs Hoka Speedgoat 6 (2025).](https://github.com/fungiboletus/vezor_vs_speedgoat/blob/main/README.md)
- [Every Bit Counts, a Journey Into Prometheus Binary Data (2024).](https://fungiboletus.github.io/journey-prometheus-binary-data/)
- [KubeMQ, the Kubernetes native message queue broker that refuses to start on Kubernetes (2023).](https://fungiboletus.github.io/kubemq-blogpost/)
- [A post about FLoC tracking (2021).](https://fungiboletus.github.io/floc-tracking/)
- [An attempt at estimating the actual top speed of the SSC Tuatara fastest production car record, using youtube-dl and audacity (2020).](https://fungiboletus.github.io/ssc-rpm/)

I used to have more but those should stay burried deep in the Wayback Machine. And they are written in French.

Here is the masterpiece though, my programming language inspired by raving rabbids:

- [GWAAAAAAAH (French, 2009, Wayback Machine).](https://web.archive.org/web/20121101153719/http://www.blogjaune.fr/GWAAAAAAAH)
- [GWAAAAAAAH (English, 2013, Wayback Machine).](https://web.archive.org/web/20140119044635/http://blogjaune.fr:80/gwaaaaaaah/)

## Open-Source Projects with the Highest World Impact

For sure.

## Open-Source Projects I'm Somewhat Proud Of

## Some Open-Source Contributions I'm also Proud Of

I do random minor contributions to open-source projects. Here are a few that I think could be interesting:

I enjoy solving some problems of the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) every year. Here are some of my solutions:

- [2021 Rust](https://github.com/fungiboletus/advent_of_code_2021_rust)

## Research Papers

I'm by no means a research paper machine, as you can see in my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e88AHh0AAAAJ).
